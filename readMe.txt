Welcome to my Portfolio site! I built this starting with the main page - index.html. I used a .gif for the background at the top. The portfolio section is positioned using relative positioning, and the descriptions that pop up on hover are absolute. Image names may be confusing because I changed them so many times (for example, "flowers" is an image of my hand holing the book I made). Throughout the site I use a font called Calibri. In the navigation, Resume and Contact are linked to a spot on the main page, but Resume takes you to another page. The resume page navigation has a link to the Home page. 
I set up my resume page with containing gray boxes that each held chunks of information. The way I made the two columns was by floating the items on the left to that side. It is responsive because the boxes on the right resize as the webpage does, but I can’t get the containers on the left-hand side to have the same response. One of my favorite things I used was the bar graph I created using a table, in place of the image that I had placed before. The pages that have my work are set up using CSS grid. Each piece of my work is also a link, so the user can see the work on its’ own page.
